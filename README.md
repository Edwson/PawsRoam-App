### 🌐 Multi-Language Development Requirements

#### **IMPORTANT: JULEs Development Consideration**
**When building this project with JULEs, ensure ALL development considers multi-language support from the ground up:**

#### Supported Languages
- **English** (Default) - Global standard, primary development language
- **日本語** (Japanese) - Complete localization for Japanese market
- **繁體中文** (Traditional Chinese) - Full support for Taiwan and Hong Kong markets

#### Critical Development Guidelines for JULEs:
1. **Database Design**: All text fields must support UTF-8MB4 encoding
2. **String Management**: Use language files/constants, never hardcode text
3. **UI Components**: Design responsive layouts that accommodate different text lengths
4. **Date/Time**: Format according to locale (US: MM/DD/YYYY, JP: YYYY/MM/DD, TW: YYYY/MM/DD)
5. **Currency**: Support multiple currencies (USD, JPY, TWD)
6. **Right-to-Left**: Prepare CSS for potential RTL support
7. **Font Loading**: Include web fonts that support all character sets
8. **Form Validation**: Locale-specific validation rules
9. **Image Alt Text**: Prepare for translated alt attributes
10. **URL Structure**: Consider language prefixes (/en/, /jp/, /tw/)

#### Localization Implementation:
```php
// Language file structure required
/lang/
  /en/
    - common.php
    - business.php
    - pawssafe.php
    - pawsai.php
  /jp/
    - common.php
    - business.php
    - pawssafe.php
    - pawsai.php
  /tw/
    - common.php
    - business.php
    - pawssafe.php
    - pawsai.php
```

#### CSS Considerations for Multi-Language:
```css
/* Text expansion accommodation */
.button { min-width: 120px; }
.nav-item { padding: 0.5rem 1rem; }

/* Font stack for multi-language */
body {
  font-family: 
    'Inter', /* English */
    'Hiragino Sans', 'Yu Gothic', /* Japanese */
    'Microsoft JhengHei', 'PingFang TC', /* Traditional Chinese */
    sans-serif;
}

/* Text direction support */
[dir="rtl"] .text-left { text-align: right; }
[dir="rtl"] .text-right { text-align: left; }
```

// Service abstraction for future microservices
interface ServiceInterface {
    public function process($data): array;
    public function healthCheck(): bool;
}

class ServiceRegistry {
    private static $services = [
        'maps' => GoogleMapsService::class,        // Can be replaced with MapboxService
        'ai' => GeminiAIService::class,           // Can be replaced with OpenAIService
        'payment' => StripePaymentService::class, // Can add PayPalService, etc.
        'notification' => EmailService::class,    // Can add SMSService, PushService
        'search' => DatabaseSearchService::class  // Can be replaced with ElasticsearchService
    ];
    
    public static function getService($name): ServiceInterface {
        $class = self::$services[$name];
        return new $class();
    }
    
    public static function replaceService($name, $class) {
        self::$services[$name] = $class;
    }
}
```

#### 📱 **API Versioning for Future Compatibility**
```php
// API versioning system
class APIVersionManager {
    private static $versions = [
        'v1' => [
            'deprecated' => false,
            'supported_until' => '2026-12-31',
            'endpoints' => ['business', 'user', 'pawssafe']
        ],
        'v2' => [
            'deprecated' => false,
            'supported_until' => '2027-12-31',
            'endpoints' => ['business', 'user', 'pawssafe', 'ai', 'social']
        ]
    ];
    
    public static function route($version, $endpoint) {
        $namespace = "App\\API\\V{$version}\\Controllers\\";
        return $namespace . ucfirst($endpoint) . 'Controller';
    }
}

// URL structure: /api/v1/business/search, /api/v2/business/search
```

#### 🔧 **Configuration Management System**
```php
// Centralized configuration for scalability
class ConfigManager {
    private static $configs = [
        'app' => [
            'name' => 'PawsRoam',
            'version' => '1.0.0',
            'debug' => false,
            'maintenance' => false
        ],
        'features' => [
            'pawssafe_enabled' => true,
            'ai_assistant_enabled' => true,
            'payment_processing' => true,
            'social_features' => true,
            'advanced_analytics' => false // Future feature
        ],
        'integrations' => [
            'google_maps' => ['enabled' => true, 'version' => 'v3'],
            'gemini_ai' => ['enabled' => true, 'model' => 'gemini-pro'],
            'stripe' => ['enabled' => true, 'webhook_secret' => '***'],
            // Future integrations
            'openai' => ['enabled' => false],
            'mapbox' => ['enabled' => false],
            'paypal' => ['enabled' => false]
        ]
    ];
}
```

#### 🗄️ **Caching Strategy for Scale**
```php
// Multi-layer caching system
class CacheManager {
    private static $drivers = [
        'file' => FileCache::class,
        'redis' => RedisCache::class,
        'memcached' => MemcachedCache::class,
        'database' => DatabaseCache::class
    ];
    
    private static $strategies = [
        'business_search' => ['driver' => 'redis', 'ttl' => 300],
        'user_preferences' => ['driver' => 'file', 'ttl' => 3600],
        'translations' => ['driver' => 'memcached', 'ttl' => 86400],
        'api_responses' => ['driver' => 'redis', 'ttl' => 60]
    ];
}
```

## 🤖 JULEs Development Instructions

### **Critical Multi-Language Implementation for JULEs:**

When JULEs builds this project, it MUST implement multi-language support with future scalability in every component:

#### 1. **Database Schema Requirements**
```sql
-- All text columns must be utf8mb4_unicode_ci
CREATE TABLE businesses (
  name VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci,
  description TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci,
  -- Add language-specific columns where needed
  name_jp VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci,
  name_tw VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci
);

-- Language preference table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id INT,
  language ENUM('en', 'jp', 'tw') DEFAULT 'en',
  timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'UTC',
  currency ENUM('USD', 'JPY', 'TWD') DEFAULT 'USD'
);
```

#### 2. **PHP Language System Implementation**
```php
// Required language function structure
function __($key, $params = [], $lang = null) {
  // Load appropriate language file
  // Return translated string with parameter substitution
}

// Example usage in all PHP files:
echo __('welcome_message'); // "Welcome to PawsRoam"
echo __('business_count', ['count' => 5]); // "Found 5 businesses"
```

#### 3. **Frontend JavaScript i18n**
```javascript
// Required JavaScript translation system
const i18n = {
  init(language) { /* Load language JSON */ },
  t(key, params = {}) { /* Return translated string */ }
};

// Usage in all JavaScript:
alert(i18n.t('error_occurred'));
document.title = i18n.t('page_title_home');
```

#### 4. **CSS Multi-Language Support**
Every CSS class must consider text expansion:
```css
/* Required for all buttons/text elements */
.btn { min-width: 100px; white-space: nowrap; }
.card-title { min-height: 2.5rem; }
.navigation-item { padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem; }

/* Language-specific fonts */
html[lang="jp"] { font-family: 'Hiragino Sans', 'Yu Gothic', sans-serif; }
html[lang="tw"] { font-family: 'Microsoft JhengHei', 'PingFang TC', sans-serif; }
```

#### 5. **Form Validation Per Language**
```php
// Different validation rules per language
$validation_rules = [
  'en' => ['phone' => '/^\+?[1-9]\d{1,14}$/'],
  'jp' => ['phone' => '/^0\d{1,4}-\d{1,4}-\d{4}$/'],
  'tw' => ['phone' => '/^09\d{8}$/']
];
```

#### 6. **API Response Multi-Language**
All API endpoints must return localized content:
```php
// API responses must include translated fields
return json_encode([
  'name' => $business->getLocalizedName($user_language),
  'description' => $business->getLocalizedDescription($user_language),
  'success_message' => __('booking_confirmed', [], $user_language)
]);
```

### **JULEs Must Create These Scalable Files:**

#### Future-Proof Language Files Structure:
```
/lang/
  /_templates/                 # Templates for adding new languages
    common.template.php
    business.template.php
  /en/ (English - Default)
    common.php
    business.php
    pawssafe.php
    pawsai.php
    regions.php               # Region-specific terms
    currencies.php            # Currency formatting
  /jp/ (Japanese)
    common.php + all files
  /tw/ (Traditional Chinese)
    common.php + all files
  /ko/ (Korean - Future)      # Ready for expansion
  /th/ (Thai - Future)
  /de/ (German - Future)
```

#### Expandable JavaScript Translation System:
```
/assets/js/lang/
  _template.json              # Template for new languages
  en.json
  jp.json
  tw.json
  config.js                   # Language configuration
  loader.js                   # Dynamic language loading
```

#### Regional Configuration Files:
```
/config/regions/
  apac.php                    # Asia-Pacific settings
  europe.php                  # European settings
  americas.php                # Americas settings
  global.php                  # Global defaults
```

#### Plugin System Structure:
```
/plugins/
  _skeleton/                  # Plugin development template
    plugin.php
    config.json
    README.md
  /core/                      # Core system plugins
    maps-google/
    ai-gemini/
    payment-stripe/
  /community/                 # Community plugins (future)
```

#### Theme System for Regional Customization:
```
/themes/
  default/                    # Global default theme
    css/
    js/
    images/
  regional/
    japan/                    # Japan-specific styling
    taiwan/                   # Taiwan-specific styling
    europe/                   # Europe-specific styling
```

### **User Interface Requirements:**
- Language switcher in header (flags + text)
- Persistent language selection (cookies/database)
- Graceful fallback to English if translation missing
- Admin panel for managing translations
- Text expansion handling in all layouts
